about=Vegetation plays an important role in mitigating the effects of desertification and degradation phenomena. The vegetation quality was assessed in terms of : Fire risk and regenerative ability (affects land degradation, soil erosion rates and biodiversity losses); Soil erosion protection (an important factor in controlling the intensity and the frequency of overland flow and erosion); Drought resistance (the capability of an ecosystem to adapt to, or resist, aridity and long droughts ); Plant cover (to reduce runoff and sediment loss).
